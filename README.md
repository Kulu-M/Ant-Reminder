# DateReminder

## About

Part taken from Ant Manager

Reminds you of the Date when to feed ants (counted in days). There are three fields for water, sugar and protein. 

When having refreshed the resources of your ants you click on the respective buttons. The date is saved and you are reminded in three days.


##Still to do:

1. The prog is only updating status on startup.
When the date is changing (00:00:00) it will not be counted - therefore the prog isnt working on pcs which runs 24/7.

Method "DateChanged();" not working.
